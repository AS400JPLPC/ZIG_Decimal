# zig_Decimal<br>
<br>
processing decimal numbers with mpdecimal as a backdrop<br>
<br>
***I wrote this lib to free myself from arithmetic problems on large decimals***<br>

This part explains why we need it.<br>

Another source that inspired me and that joins what I think 1990 <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       integer: number of integers in front of the point<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       scale: number of integers behind the point<br>
<br>


<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   string: if the scale part is larger than its definition,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it rounds then adds zeros if necessary<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(respects the SQL display alignment standard on the left ex: 1.00)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   rate: raises a value with the percentage ex ( n = (val x nbr) , val = (n x %1.25)<br>

Big is working on memory leaks.<BR/>
Now I think it's fixed.
<br>
<br>
<br>
&rarr; 2024-12-19 The build in the library as well as in src-zig is compliant and without redundancy.
